# Mobile-Detection-with-cup-carbon
ABSTRACT


                        CupCarbon is a Smart City and Internet of things Wireless Sensor Network (SCI-WSN) simulator. Its objective is to design, visualize, debug and validate distributed algorithms for monitoring, environmental data collection, etc., and to create environmental scenarios such as fires, gas, mobiles, and generally within educational and scientific projects. Not only it can help to visually explain the basic concepts of sensor networks and how they work; it may also support scientists to test their wireless topologies, protocols, etc
                        The Mobile detection with CupCarbon specifies the main aim of Mobile detection. For this detection we use “Senscript”- Language used to generate code in CupCarbon console. In CupCarbon we are provided with map in that map we create nodes and perform the detection. By using Senscript we generate the code for detection and this code is implemented in CupCarbon console. After Detection of mobiles the message has to be sent to the sink. The overall Simulation is done in Graphical User Interface.
